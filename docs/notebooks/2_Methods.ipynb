    "## Purpose and Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Across disciplines, spatial accessibility indicators allow you to address many questions, like who does and does not live within reach of specific amenities/services or where they might be spatial mismatches between supply and demand of these services. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to present the methodology for 1) efficiently and transparently estimating network-based travel times or distances at scale (p2p module), and, based on this, 2) for generating the spatial access and coverage metrics, especially the access score (Model module). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how the Python modules p2p and Models work that are part of the [spatial access package](https://pypi.org/project/spatial-access/). The p2p module is part of an open-source backend infrastructure for estimating network-based travel times for three travel modes: walking, driving, and biking. You can also read in a travel time matrix generated in OpenTrip Planner (otp). These **travel time matrices** serve as the input for the **access** and **coverage** **metrics** in Models.py to identify potential spatial access gaps. Access metrics are attributes of points of **origins** while coverage metrics are attributes of the **destination** points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next notebook ([3_Travel_Time_Matrix.ipynb](./3_Travel_Time_Matrix.ipynb)) walks you through the computation of the travel time matrix, followed by three notebooks with demos of the metrics on spatial access ([4_Access_Metrics.ipynb](./4_Access_Metrics.ipynb)), coverage ([5_Coverage_Metrics.ipynb](./5_Coverage_Metrics.ipynb)), and two-stage floating catchment areas ([6_TSFCA.ipynb](./6_TSFCA.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we analyze health facilities in the City of Chicago with [public data](http://makosak.github.io/chihealthaccess/index.html). You are also encouraged to use your own data. We highlight the **_parameters_** you can specify as options for your own data.\n"

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we decide to create a new package for computing travel times at scale?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to alternative state-of-the-art options, this package computes access **more efficiently** in an **open-source** and **scalable** framework that runs **offline** for confidential data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating large shortest path matrices for different travel modes is an important tool for spatial data science, but does not currently have a solution in Python that is open source, highly scalable and efficient. Several tools currently exist for similar purposes as this software package. OSRM, Valhalla, and OpenTripPlanner, among other services, offer matrix APIs to compute the shortest path distance for datasets but the open-source solutions break down when applied to very large datasets without dockerized solutions (same for pgrouting). On the other hand, both Graphhopper and GoogleMaps charge for the service, which becomes prohibitely expensive at scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above services caps the number of entries in a request at 25-50, meaning that generating a matrix with 500,000 rows requires breaking the original matrix into millions of submatrices and making millions of individual queries. This approach works well for small datasets, but includes substantial overhead which is prohibitive on a large scale. The point-to-point shortest path algorithm presented here (p2p) can generate matrices between a set of origin and destination points (or origins-origins) in 2 lines of code, efficiently and with a low memory footprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example in this notebook generates a driving shortest path matrix for 46,251 blocks in Chicago in ~14 minutes (18 minutes for walking) whereas the same task took > 18 hours using Valhalla. For this particular dataset, the mean difference between time values for the driving shortest path matrix and Google Maps' Matrix API is 2 minutes.\n",

    "## Overview of Travel Time Matrices \n",
    "\n",
    "Travel time matrices can be computed for walking, biking and driving times between origin and destination points. Instead, you can also choose to compute distances (in meters) between these points. We will refer to travel times by default in these notebooks (since this is the default setting and often of greater interest) but distances are implied and can easily be computed by changing one parameter (use_meters=True, as shown in the [TRAVEL TIME MATRIX DEMO](./3_Travel_Time_Matrix.ipynb)). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two routes to compute these matrices: Creating **asymmetric** (nxm) or **symmetric** (nxn) matrices. Symmetric matrices are estimated origin to origin, while asymmetric matrices calculate origin to destination. You can generate a symmetric distance matrix and snap the points of interest to the matrix or create an asymmetric distance matrix that already incorporates origin and destination points. The symmetric approach is more appropriate when you need to calculate several metrics for the same area and different destinations.\n",

    "    - **Access Sum**: Sum of an attribute of destinations within a catchment area\n",
    "    - **Access Model**: Score from each origin to destination (e.g. tract to health facilities) (gravity-model)\n",

    "Nodes are latitude and longitude coordinates (projected in WGS 84) that represent the map’s features. Ways are a list of nodes that compose the geometry features (i.e. point, line, polygon) within a map, depicting streets, waterways, parks, etc. Relations express the relationship between nodes and ways. Lastly, tags are attached to nodes, ways or relations, storing metadata about the map objects.  \n",

The complexity of the network depends on the number of nodes within this bounding box. In contrast, the number of observations should not affect the efficiency of the running times. In order to get the distances from OSM, OSM-Net calculates the distances of the relations, creating the edges that are queried for the travel time estimation. To estimate these distances, both origin and destination files should be using the same WGS 84 coordinate reference (EPSG:4326)."

    "In order to calculate the network distance matrix, first, the code extracts the outermost value of latitude/longitude from the origin input table to create a bounding box of the area of interest. The size of the bounding box is buffered, specifically it is increased by 'epsilon', to avoid cutting off the network of datapoints near the boundary of the bounding box. The user can tweak the value of epsilon in **Configs.py**.\n",
    "\n",
    "P2P uses a k-d tree to match each point in the origin and destination data to its nearest neighbor node in the OSM network, and then finds the Vincenty distance between the two points. Vincenty's formulae estimate the geodesic distance between two points according to an ellipsoidal model of the Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the travel time computation between origin and destination, the classic Dijkstra's algorithm is then applied to consider every possible route and then select the fastest route. Therefore, P2P also uses an adjacency list representation for Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for every node to every other node in the underlying OSM network, but it can skip doing any processing for nodes that do not have an attached origin data point. The advantage of this approach is that it scales to very large datasets; as opposed to the adjacency matrix representation (which can easily exceed the memory of many systems for reasonably large datasets). P2P never loads the entire network into memory at one time, meaning the memory footprint is relatively small. This also means the multi-threaded performance of P2P greatly outperforms the single-threaded performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For every point in the origin dataset to every point in the destination dataset, the base impedence is the cost found using Dijkstra. To the base value we add the 'last mile' inferred impedence from the origin and destination points to their respective nearest nodes, determined by the Euclidean distance and a constant traversal speed. The 'last mile' is figurative; in the City of Chicago, for instance, 75 percent of block centroids were within 100 meters of the nearest OSM node and 95 percent of block centroids were within 200 meters.  \n",

Therefore, Kosaraju's algorithm for directed graph strong connectedness is implemented in p2p (lines 713 - 805 of p2p.py under \\_request_network2 function). In graph theory, strong connectivity means that a path exists between any pair of nodes. Thus, we implement Kosaraju's algorithm to identify the disconnected nodes and we delete them from the network. "

Therefore, load one input file if you want a symmetric distance graph, or two for an asymmetric matrix.

You can adjust this parameter for different populations.  For example, [Chicago](https://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/cdot/StreetandSitePlanDesignStandards407.pdf) estimates an average block dimension of 660 feet (200 m) by 330 feet (100 m). These dimensions might change across cities; therefore, the average walking speed of 3 mph estimates that a person, on average, walks a block in 72 to 144 seconds (1.2 - 2.4 min). The default average speeds and speed limits for different OSM type of roads can be found in **Config.py** and specified when running the matrices.   \n",

It can be specified within the **Configs.py** file.\n",

Larger epsilons result in longer computation times, but smaller epsilons result in slightly reduced accuracy at the very edges of the bounding box, especially for driving networks. The default is currently set at 0.05, which seems to balance the two reasonably well. (+/-) 0.02 will result in a large increase/decrease in computation time and accuracy. If too many values are defined as -1, it means that the epsilon is too small. Refer to the epsilon calibration to assess if this value must change and the matrix contains too many -1. The value of -1 is hardcoded in the tmat.h file and is considered as an NaN value of the origins when estimating the metrics.  \n",

    "The figure below shows a point of origin (black x) and the three health facilities that can be reached within a 30 minute walk from there: two FQHCs (blue dots, 12 and 25 minutes away) and one hospital (red dot, 10 minutes away). The table next to the map lists these three facilities, the travel times to them, and their respective importance and variety weights, specified in the weights dictionary above. The closest facility, the hospital, is weighted as 10, followed by the next closest Federally Qualified Health Center, weighted as 8 and the third closest health center, weighted as 7,\n",
    "\n",
    "The last column contains the  weights from the distance decay function shown in the image to the right of the table. The distance decay function weighs each destination depending on its relative distance to the point of origin: closer destinations are weighed higher that more distant destinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This image shows how the distance decay function maps a given travel time (x-axis) to a score from 0-1 (y-axis). The 10-minute travel time to the hospital is weighted by the distance decay function with a score of 0.9 (and smaller weights of 0.81 and 0.1 for the other two facilities at the larger 12 and 25 min distances). \n",
    "\n",
    "The score for each facility Is the product of the importance/variety weights and these distance decay weights: As shown in the table below, these scores are 9, 6.48 and 0.70 for the hospital and two FQHCs, respectively. The final score is the sum of these facility scores: In this case, it is 16.18.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the more categories you have, the larger your score will be. By default, the score is not normalized to observe the overall distribution across places and time, but the results can also be standardized. \n"
